I'm adding new interactions all the time, so check it out! At the moment, I'm focusing on electrical and mechanical lookups and calculations.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@dkavanagh is working on this project for his own workshop, and hopefully it's useful in yours!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNothing yet, but feel free to file an issue!\r\n",
